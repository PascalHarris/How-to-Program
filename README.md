# How-to-Program
Snippets of code which go along with a book that I'm writing for my kids

(from Introduction)
This guide will, I hope, help beginners to write programs in Scratch, BASIC and Python. Scratch is a basic graphical programming language in which programs are created by dragging and dropping blocks which represent code, into the workspace. It's easy, it's fun - and it can teach the basics of programming. What Scratch can't do is teach the finer points of 'real world' programming â€“ for example, you couldn't sell an application written in Scratch or get a job as a Scratch developer.

Next on the scale of programming is BASIC - which older readers may remember as the programming language installed on the microcomputer that they had when they were younger. It's a proper programming language, although it lacks many of the features of more modern languages. You probably could get a job programming in BASIC - and you might even be able to sell software written in it.

The final language discussed here is Python. Python is modern, and can do nearly everything that modern languages can do - although perhaps not quite as quickly as C# or Swift. You can think of Python as being like an ultra modern BASIC - and it makes an excellent jumping off point if you want to get into programming as a hobby or a career.

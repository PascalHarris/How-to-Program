1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a whatsit.

   Being a whatsit includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a whatsit.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER whatsit.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a whatsit would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a lemonade.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and having a strop when it goes wrong makes
you a MASSIVE whatsit. Fix the problem yourself. A non-whatsit would submit the fix back.
